# DataAnonymization
A project created for MSDS 7349: Data and Network Security to anonymize data to allow for true privacy and anonymity while yielding statistical results that are within a 95% confidence interval of the original data. By Noelle Brown, Lu Cheng, Shanqing Gu, Alexandra Norman, and Lizzy Sterling.

* Languages used: R (sdcMicro)
* Software used: ARX

## Results
Using sdcMicro and ARX, we were able to anonymize dataset with sensitive information so that there was no evidence that the anonymized dataset was significantly different than the original dataset.
